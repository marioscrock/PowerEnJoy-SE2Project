\section{Risk management}\label{sec:riskManagement}
This section describe possible risks for the \emph{PowerEnJoy system} and some possible reactive and proactive strategies to mitigate them.
\subsection{Project risks}
\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Failure to achieve a deadline}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}& Various contingencies could bring to fail to achieve deadlines. \\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&Moderate\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Moderate\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}& Planning the project schedule it is quite impossible to consider all possible issues that may arise during the project development, so it could be useful to allocate some extra time after each major phase of the project in order to avoid a tasks shift on the schedule due to a fail to achieve a deadline.\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Change of requirements}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}& Requirements may need some changes: not exhaustive requirements, misunderstood requirements or missing requirements. \\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&Moderate\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Moderate/Serious\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}& To avoid the need to change requirements it is really useful to meet all the project stakeholders from the beginning of the development of the project (for example also allowing some users to interact with mockups of the application during the requirements design phase). 

The change of requirements during the development phase could bring to the need to change already implemented software and/or software design. The relevance on the project of that change must be evaluted: if the issue is serious and is customer fault it could be necessary to re-discuss project contract, schedule and estimated budget. 

Anyway a modular and reusable thinking of the software architecture could help to be more reactive to the need of requirements change.\\

\subsection{Technical risks}
\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Underestimation of requests' load}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}&Traffic and requests are much more than what has been estimated, resulting in high latency and possibly in service unavailability\\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&Low\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Serious\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}&Analyze the traffic through all component, consider an upgrade of hardware components, external API contracts and traffic plans. During the development use a modular software design to manage multiple requests in parallel and to improve scalability.\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Wrong external component specification}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}&An external component is not compliant to its specification\\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&Low\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Serious\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}&Try to find a solution with the component's owner, if impossible find a different compatible component and consider to take legal proceedings.\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Difficulties during development phase}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}& It could happen developers experience difficulties in the development of some specific features of the system due to the lack of experience. \\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&Low\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Moderate\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}& It may be required to think about asking consulting to external companies.\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}


\subsection{Business risks}
\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Competitors}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}&Competitors saturate the market with their car sharing services\\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&High\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Serious\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}&Make some market surveys in order to determine and implement some \emph{killer features}\\
