\section{User interface design}
In this section are presented some mockups of the main features and related user interfaces the system is supposed to offer to the user and to the customer care through the proper web-based application.
\subsection{User app}
The user app must have a charming and intuitive user interface in order to provide a easy-to-use experience to the user. That interface must be optimized for mobile devices.

\subsubsection{Login page}
Simple initial page for the application to allow the user to authenticate to the system through username and password. A new user can access the registration process through the \emph{New User} button. \\
As specified in the requirements section, that page also allows a guest user or a \emph{banned} registered user to access to customer care contact information.
