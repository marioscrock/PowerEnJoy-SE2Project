We need to design a system which allows communications with many agents such as cars, users, external systems, etc.
Moreover we recognize that in most of the interactions the system is providing a service to agents so, after taking in consideration different alternatives, we decided to use a client-server architectural approach.

Cars offer to the system a set of primitives which allow it to interact with them: in this case it is clear that cars are providing the system services, so they can be identified as serves while the system acts as a client; on the other end the notification functionality offered by cars clearly yields to an event-based approach due to the asynchronous nature of such interactions, this lead us to use a publish-subscribe paradigm for these specific interactions.
