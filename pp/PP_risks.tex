\section{Risk management}\label{sec:riskManagement}
This section describe possible risks for the \emph{PowerEnJoy system} and some possible strategies to mitigate them.
\subsection{Project risks}
\subsection{Technical risks}
\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Underestimation of requests' load}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}&Traffic and requests are much more than what has been estimated, resulting in high latency and possibly in service unavailability\\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&Low\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Serious\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}&Analyze the traffic through all component, consider an upgrade of hardware components, external API contracts and traffic plans. During the development use a modular software design to manage multiple requests in parallel and to improve scalability.\\
\bottomrule

\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Wrong external component specification}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}&An external component is not compliant to its specification\\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&Low\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Serious\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}&Try to find a solution with the component's owner, if impossible find a different compatible component and consider to take legal proceedings.\\
\bottomrule

\subsection{Business risks}
\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\linewidth}}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Competitors}}\\
\toprule
\textbf{Description}&Competitors saturate the market with their car sharing services\\
\midrule
\textbf{Probability}&High\\
\midrule
\textbf{Effects}&Serious\\
\midrule
\textbf{Actions}&Make some market surveys in order to determine and implement some \emph{killer features}\\

\item Problemi J2EE
\item Car sharing non sfonda -> difficoltÃ  fondi per mantenimento software
\item NecessitÃ  cambio fornitore automobili
\item Security
\item Personnel shortfall
\item Unrealistic schedule/budget
\item Wrong functionality
\item Wrong user interface (not usable)
\item Goldplating -> Perfezionismo
\item Requirements volatility
\item Bad external components -> soprattutto difficulty interface with car
\item Bad external tasks
\item Real-time shortfalls
\item Capability shortfalls
\end{itemize}
Failure to achieve a deadline (milestone)\\
API downtime\\
API changes\\
Aumentano requisiti > coinvolgere utenti in fase di sviluppo\\
Data loss > backup
