\section{List of Issues}
\subsection*{[2.1] Naming Conventions}
\subsubsection*{[1] All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests}
\begin{description}
	\item[L 57:] The name of the {\tt CheckoutHelper} type variable {\tt ch} is not meaningful and difficult to understand out of the declaration context
	\item[L 272:] The name of the {\tt List<GenericValue>} type variable {\tt fcp} is not meaningful and difficult to understand out of the declaration context
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{[2] If one-character variables are used, they are used only for temporary “throwaway” variables}
\begin{description}
	\item[L 329:] The name chosen for the {\tt Iterator<GenericValue>} returned from {values.iterator()} is {\tt i}; although since this variable is only used inside a loop, it is not a problem
	\item[L 331, 333:] The name chosen for the {\tt GenericValue} returned from {\tt i.next()} is {\tt v}; although since this variable is only used inside a loop, it is not a problem
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{[5] Method names should be verbs, with the first letter of each addition word capitalized}
\begin{description}
	\item[L 162:] The {\tt paidInOut(String type)} method name is not a verb which refers to the actions made inside it. Since it seems like it only stores the payment referred to a transaction into the log, it could be renamed {\tt logPayment(String type)}
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{[7] Constants are declared using all uppercase with words separated by an underscore}
\begin{description}
	\item[L 51:] The {\tt resource} constant is not uppercase
	\item[L 52:] The {\tt module} constant is not uppercase
	\item[L 324:] The {\tt externalCode} constant is not uppercase
\end{description}

\subsection*{[2.4] File Organization}

\subsubsection*{[12] Blank lines and optional comments are used to separate sections}
\begin{description}
	\item[L 18,19:] There is a missing space between the {\tt License} section and the {\tt package} statements
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{[13] Where practical, line length does not exceed 80 characters}
\begin{description}
	\item[L 78:] The line is 86 characters long, since it is less than 120 characters long and there is no practical way to break it, in can be left as it is
	\item[L 139:] The line is 169 characters long, three high-level breaks should be used, after {\tt "PosTerminalState",} , after {\tt "posTerminalId,} and after {\tt getTransactionId())),}
	\item[L 143:] The line is 104 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt UtilDateTime.nowTimestamp(),} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 199:] The line is 115 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt resource,} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 207:] The line is 86 characters long, since it is less than 120 characters long and there is no practical way to break it, in can be left as it is
	\item[L 214:] The line is 105 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt =} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 226:] The line is 183 characters long, two high-level breaks should be used, after {\tt =} and after {\tt getProductStoreId(),}
	\item[L 264:] The line is 128 characters long, one high-level break should be used after {\tt "Facility",} 
	\item[L 274:] The line is 135 characters long, one high-level break should be used after {\tt "FacilityContactMechPurpose",} 
	\item[L 316:] The line is 153 characters long, one high-level break should be used after {\tt "paymentMethodTypeId",}
	\item[L 319:] The line is 140 characters long, one high-level break should be used after {\tt "ProductStorePaymentSetting",}
	\item[L 362:] The line is 92 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt String refNum,} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 374:] The line is 92 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt +} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 386:] The line is 85 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt "] Amount : " +} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 395:] The line is 111 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt String paymentMethodTypeId,} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 403:] The line is 85 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt "] Amount : " +} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 412:] The line is 112 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt String expDate,} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 447:] The line is 116 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt paymentIndex +} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 454:] The line is 90 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt String refNum,} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 463:] The line is 86 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt String refNum,} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 472:] The line is 86 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt String refNum,} , so it should be broken
	\item[L 506:] The line is 83 characters long, even though it is less than 120 characters long, a high-level brake can be applied after {\tt code,} , so it should be broken
	
\end{description}
Note that the comma should be the last character before each break.
