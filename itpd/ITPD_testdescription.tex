\section{Individual Steps and Test Description}

This section describes the main tests that will be used to verify that the elements integrated, as specified in the integration sequence, behave as expected. 

\subsection{Test Description}

This section describes the integration tests for most pair of components to be integrated; the integration test are described through the expected behaviour of the methods of the second component against the calls of the first in terms of relations between \emph{input} and \emph{expected output}.

\subsubsection{Other Tests}
In this section we describe integration tests related to components whose methods were not detailed in the \emph{Design Document} \cite{DD} since they are mostly basic functions related to user and data management.

\paragraph{AccessManager, DataProvider} 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Login functionality}: test if the \emph{DataProvider} allows \emph{AccessManager} to check the username and password given by a user,  corresponds to a user correctly registered, with a null token associated(email confirmed) and a \emph{not banned} state.
\item \textbf{Registration functionality}: test if the \emph{DataProvider} allows \emph{AccessManager} correctly creates a new user record in the database when a registration request is received.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{UserInformationManager, DataProvider} 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Query functionality}: test if the \emph{DataProvider} allows the \emph{UserInformationManager} to retrieve rent and payment history of a user and to retrieve or edit personal info of a user; moreover test if the behaviour of the integrated components is correct both in the case the \emph{UserInformationManagerDriver} behaves as a user and in the case it behaves as a customer care operator.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{UserAppServer, AccessManager}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Login functionality}: test if the \emph{AccessManager} confirms that a user can log into the system only if username and password given by \emph{UserAppServer} corresponds to a user correctly registered, with a null token associated(email confirmed) and a \emph{not banned} state.
\item \textbf{Registration functionality}: test if the \emph{AccessManager} allows \emph{UserAppServer} to make requests about the registration of a user checking the information provided as defined in the \emph{RASD document}\cite{RASD} and correctly stores the user information.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{UserAppServer, UserInformationManager}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Information retrieval functionality}: test if the \emph{UserInformationManager} correctly provides the \emph{UserAppServer} with user's personal information, his rent history and his payment history.
\item \textbf{Information edit functionality}: test if the \emph{UserInformationManager} correctly allows \emph{UserAppServer} to modify user's editable personal information.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{CustomerCareServer, UserInformationManager}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Information retrieval functionality}: test if the \emph{UserInformationManager} correctly provides the \emph{CustomerCareServer} with a list of users, the Customer Care selection of a user personal information, his rent history and his payment history.
\end{itemize}
