\section{Use cases identification}
\subsection{Scenarios}
Here are some scenarios that describe the usage of the system.
\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
\label{scenario:1}
Francesco wants to have a beer with his friend Vincenzo so Francesco logs in to system and searches for cars nearby. He notices that there are two cars available next to his house, he decides to reserve the one with more battery and after few minutes he reaches it. He starts to drive until he reaches Vincenzo's house, Vincenzo gets into the car and they arrive to the beer house where they terminate the rent.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
\label{scenario:2}
Mirjana has been told by her friend Elisa that a new car sharing service is available in their city and so she decided to give it a try as she wants to go shopping in the city center. She registers to the system providing all information requested, she inserts the destination address and enables the money saving option. She is provided by the system with a charging station not far from the shopping center and, as it is a sunny day, she decided to take that location as destination in order to achieve a discount and reach the shopping center on foot. 

\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
\label{scenario:3}
Giovanni is really interested in electric cars so he decides to use the PowerEnJoy system. He wants to go to the museum in the afternoon so he reserves a car. After one hour he is notified by the system that his reservation is expired and he is charged of a 1\euro\ fee. When he is ready to exit his house he notices that the same car is still available so he reserves it again, reaches it and starts driving. When he arrives at the destination he sees a charging station next to the museum so he decides to leave the car there plugging the charging cable in order to get a discount.

\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
\label{scenario:4}
Dino reserves a car, he reaches it and unlock the doors. He starts driving but after few minutes the engine stops and a warning icon lights up in the dashboard. He contacts the customer care service that suggests him to reserve a different car which is nearby, the customer care operator then tags the first car as not available specifying a brief description of the fault. The maintenance service is now aware of the problem and they take care of resolving the issue: a maintenance operator is sent to the car, he unlocks it  and fixes it. When the car is fully functional he tags it as available using a restricted access API of our system.

\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
\label{scenario:5}
Stefania often uses PowerEnJoy service when she is coming back home after work. Before finish her work schedule she checks with the map if there are cars nearby in order to reserve one of them: today she can see one from the window that is not present in the map because its battery is empty. After a while she checks again the map and she notices that the car is now located in a charging station nearby and it is available for a reservation.
	
\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
\label{scenario:6}
Lorenzo is driving a PowerEnJoy car in order to reach Dino's house outside the safe area. As soon as he exists the safe area the car system notifies him with a message. When he is arrived he terminates the rent, the payment is executed with an extra fee and the car is tagged as not available.

\paragraph{Notes to read the diagram}
The use case diagram represents the possible interactions of actors with the system and the different use cases in which the actors are involved.\\

The "Maintenance service system" is an external software which the system-to-be needs to interact with. \\
 
We do not consider the external payment handling system an actor since it does not start any interaction with our system, it simply reacts when our system requests its services; this interaction is encapsulated as sub-procedure in the flow of events of the "Rent payment" use case.\\

We do not consider the car an actor for the same reason, moreover the only interactions started by the car are trigger events which are very simple interactions, which we do not consider use cases.\\

\paragraph{Notes to read the diagram}
The \emph{Not Available} state includes the cases in which the car is either broken or a user left it with a critical battery level and not on charge.\\ 

The system changes the state of a car from \emph{Available} to \emph{Not Available} when its battery level is critical and the car is not on charge (see \ref{req:notAvailbleCritical}).\\

Even if the car is left with no battery left, it is still able to communicate with the system, so the rent can end normally and the maintenance service will take care the car
(see \ref{da:zeroBattery}).
