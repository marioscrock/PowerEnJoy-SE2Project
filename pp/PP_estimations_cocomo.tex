\subsection{Cost and effort estimation: COCOMO II} 
COnstructive COst MOdel II (COCOMO II) is a model that allows one to estimate the cost, effort, and schedule when planning a new software development activity. COCOMO II is the latest major extension to the original \mbox{COCOMO 81} model published in 1981.

It consists of three submodels, each one offering increased fidelity the further along one is in the project planning and design process \cite{COCOMO}.

Since the system we are to develop is brand new and there is no previous system we have to adopt the \emph{Early design} submodel.

\paragraph{COCOMO effort equation}\label{par:cocomoEquation}This formula estimates the project effort in Person-Months (PM)
$$PM = A \cdot Size^{E} \cdot \prod_{i \in CostDrivers}EM_{i}$$
where 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $A=2.94$ approximates a productivity constant in PM/KSLOC (Person-Months/Kilo-Source Lines of Code)
	\item $Size$ is the estimated size of the project in KSLOC, it can be deducted from Function Points analysis
	\item $E$ is an aggregation of five Scale Factors which is computed as $$E = 0.91 + 0.01 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{5}{SF_j}$$
	\item $EM$ is the Effort Multiplier derived from each Cost Driver
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Precedentedness - PREC} It is high if a product is similar to several projects previously developed by the team. Since we do not have ever develop such a big project, although we have largely understood the product objectives and there is a minimal need of innovative algorithms or innovative data processing architectures, we decide that
\DadoCenter{PREC is \textbf{LOW}}

\paragraph{Development Flexibility - FLEX} It is high if there are no specific constraints to conform to pre-established requirements and external interface specifications. The italian law establishes specific constraints regarding the characteristics and usage of car sharing systems, driving licenses and privacy policy. Requirements specified by the client do not excessively restrict the development process, some external APIs are used in order to fulfill the requirements.\\We decide that
\DadoCenter{FLEX is \textbf{NOMINAL}}

\paragraph{Risk Resolution - RESL} It is high if the project has a good risk management plan, clear definition of budget and schedule, focus on architectural definition. The \hyperref[sec:riskManagement]{Risk Management Plan} identifies generally all critical risk items and determines actions in order to resolve them. As specified in the \hyperref[sec:schedule]{Schedule section} a relevant portion of development process is devoted to establishing architecture, given general product objectives.\\Therefore we decide that
\DadoCenter{REL is \textbf{HIGH}}

\paragraph{Team Cohesion - TEAM} It is high if all project development team members are able to work in a team and share the same vision and commitment. As objectives, cultures, ages and backgrounds are the same for all team members we decide that
\DadoCenter{TEAM is \textbf{VERY HIGH}}

\paragraph{Project Maturity - PMAT} It reflects the CMMI index of the project. Since this project can be considered a managed process, planned and executed according to policies with the usage of adequate and planned resources, stakeholders constantly involved in incremental product reviews, we decide that the CMMI index is Level 2: Managed at the Project Level, therefore
\DadoCenter{PMAT is \textbf{NOMINAL}}

\paragraph{E parameter}In the \autoref{tbl:SFChosenValues} are reported the values chosen for the five Scale Factors
\begin{longtable}{ccc}
\toprule
Scale Factor&Value&Numerical Value\\
\midrule
PREC&Low&4.96\\
FLEX&Nominal&3.04\\
RESL&High&2.83\\
TEAM&Very High&1.10\\
PMAT&Nominal&4.68\\
\midrule
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Total}}&\textbf{16.61}\\
\bottomrule\\
\caption{\label{tbl:SFChosenValues}Scale factors chosen values}
\end{longtable}
The $E$ parameter of \hyperref[par:cocomoEquation]{COCOMO effort equation} is computed as
$$E = 0.91 + 0.01 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{5}{SF_j} = 0.91+0.01\cdot 16.61 = 1.0761$$


\subsubsection{Cost Drivers}
Since we refer to the \emph{Early Design} model of COCOMO II, the cost drivers are obtained averaging their \emph{Post-Architecture} counterparts as shown in \autoref{tbl:costDriverConversion}.
\begin{longtable}{cc}

\specialcell{Cost\\Driver}&\specialcell{Extra\\Low}&\specialcell{Very\\Low}&Low&Nominal&High&\specialcell{Very\\High}&\specialcell{Extra\\High}\\
\midrule
PERS &2.12 &1.62 &1.26 &1.00 &0.83 &0.63 &0.50\\
RCPX &0.49 &0.60 &0.83 &1.00 &1.33 &1.91 &2.72\\
RUSE &-	   &-	 &0.95 &1.00 &1.07 &1.15 &1.24\\
PDIF &-	   &-    &0.87 &1.00 &1.29 &1.81 &2.61\\
PREX &1.59 &1.33 &1.22 &1.00 &0.87 &0.74 &0.62\\
FCIL &1.43 &1.30 &1.10 &1.00 &0.87 &0.73 &0.62\\
SCED &-	   &1.43 &1.14 &1.00 &1.00 &1.00 &-\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\paragraph{Personnel Capability - PERS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Analyst Capability - ACAP}: Analysts are personnel who work on requirements, high-level design and detailed design. Since we consider ourselves as good analysts, with the ability to communicate and cooperate, we consider this parameter as \textbf{HIGH}.
	\item \textbf{Programmer Capability - PCAP}: This parameter reflect the capability of the programmers as a team rather than as individuals. Since all team members have already done with profit several team projects before, we consider this parameter as \textbf{HIGH}.
	\item \textbf{Personnel Continuity - PCON}: The rating scale is in terms of the projectâ€™s annual personnel turnover. Since the team is composed of 3 members and the average turnover is 2 years, this parameter is \textbf{VERY LOW}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}{ccc}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{PERS}}\\
\toprule
Cost Driver&Value&Numerical Value\\
\midrule
ACAP&High&4\\
PCAP&High&4\\
PCON&Very Low&1\\
\midrule
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Average}}&\textbf{3}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Therefore PERS is \textbf{NOMINAL}.

\paragraph{Product Reliability and Complexity - RCPX}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Required Software Reliability - RELY} This is the measure of the extent to which the software must perform its intended function over a period of time. If the effect of a software failure is only slight inconvenience then RELY is very low. Since a product failure will cause high financial loss to our client's core business, this parameter is \textbf{HIGH}.
	\item \textbf{Data Base Size - DATA} This cost driver attempts to capture the effect large test data requirements have on product development. \todo{the ratio of bytes in the testing database to SLOC in the program.}
	\item \textbf{Product Complexity - CPLX} Complexity is divided into five areas: control operations, computational operations, device-dependent operations, data management operations, and user interface management operations.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User interface management: simple use of widget set. NOMINAL
		\item Data management operations: large operational database with many updates, possibly with triggers, multi-file structured inputs, data restructuring. HIGH
		\item Device dependent Operations: I/O processing includes device selection, status checking and error processing. NOMINAL
		\item Computational operations: Use of standard math, basic matrix and vector operations. NOMINAL
		\item Control operations: Reentrant and recursive coding. Task synchronization, complex callbacks. VERY HIGH
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
