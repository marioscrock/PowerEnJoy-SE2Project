\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of this document is to report results of the \textbf{Code Inspection} activity performed on selected code extracted from a release of the \textit{Apache OFBiz project}. The main purpose of that activity is to evaluate the overall quality of the source code based upon a checklist provided \cite{Assignment}, general programming guidelines and good programming practices.

\subsection{Apache OFBiz project}
The OFBiz project is an open source project by Apache that  includes a suite of enterprise applications suchs as a ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), E-Business / E-Commerce, SCM (Supply Chain Management), MRP (Manufacturing Resource Planning), MMS/EAM (Maintenance Management System/Enterprise Asset Management).

These applications are built on a common architecture using common data, logic and process components. The loosely coupled nature of the applications makes these components easy to understand, extend and customize \cite{OFBiz}.
