\subsection{Domain Assumption}
	We assume that these assumptions hold true in the domain of our system 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GPS position is supposed to be accurate w.r.t. the defined areas
		\item GPS position and status of all cars is always available
		\item Users are able to drive a car (i.d. users have a proper driving license)
		\item Charging stations are always working and continuously monitored by the system
		\item Every time a user enters a car he ignites the engine
	\end{itemize}
