\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of the \emph{Power EnJoy Project Plan} is to provide an overview of the project with respect to parameters related to the project management. This document provides an estimation of the expected size, cost and effort for the project based upon techniques that support the estimation
procedure (Function Points, COCOMO II); it also proposes a possible schedule for the project and a related allocation of resources to accomplish tasks identified and describes the possible risks related to the project presenting some possible strategies to manage them.


\subsection{Scope}
PowerEnJoy is a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars; we are going to develop a web-based software system that will provide the functionalities normally provided by car-sharing services, such as allowing the user to register to the system in order to access it, showing the cars available near a given location and allowing a user to reserve a car before picking it up.
A screen located inside the car will show in real time the ride amount of money to the user. When the user reaches a predefined safe area and exits the car, the system will stop charging the user and will lock the car. The system will provide information about charging station location where the car can be plugged after the ride and incentivize virtuous behaviours of the users with discounts \cite{RASD}.
