\subsubsection{Discount assignment}
Let $D = \lbrace d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n\rbrace$ be the set of all applicable discounts for a specific rent.\\
The applied discount is $$d = \max_{d_i\in D} d_i$$

\subsubsection{Fee assignment}
Let $F = \lbrace f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_n\rbrace$ be the set of all applicable fees for a specific rent.\\
The applied fee is $$f = \sum_{f_i\in F} f_i$$
