\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of the PowerEnJoy Integration Test Plan Document is to describe how the integration testing is going to be accomplished for the PowerEnJoy system; it describes the entry criteria of each component for the integration, the integration strategy of the software and the subsystems, the actual integration sequence and how to verify that the components integrated perform as expected in each step of the sequence. The document also describes the tools and equipment required for testing and highlights the stubs/drivers and data required for the integration process.

\subsection{Scope}
PowerEnJoy is a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars; we are going to develop a web-based software system that will provide the functionalities normally provided by car-sharing services, such as allowing the user to register to the system in order to access it, showing the cars available near a given location and allowing a user to reserve a car before picking it up.
A screen located inside the car will show in real time the ride amount of money to the user. When the user reaches a predefined safe area and exits the car, the system will stop charging the user and will lock the car. The system will provide information about charging station location where the car can be plugged after the ride and incentivize virtuous behaviours of the users with discounts\cite{RASD}
