\section{Requirements traceability}

\subsection{Functional requirements}

In the \autoref{tbl:mappingGoalsOnComponent} is presented a mapping correspondence between the requirements defined in the RASD related to each goal and the components identified in the server component diagram.  \\

\textbf{G7} Provide a way to show to each user his rents and payments history & \mbox{UserAppServer} \mbox{UserInformationManager} \mbox{DataProvider}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G8} Provide customer service with a way to ban registered users in order to prevent them from reserving or using other cars, and enable them to use the service again & \mbox{CustomerCareServer} \mbox{UserInformationManager} \mbox{DataProvider}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G9} Allow a logged user to reserve a car, if available, and hold that reservation for an hour & \mbox{UserAppServer} \mbox{RentManager} \mbox{DataProvider}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G10} Charge a user for 1\euro{} in case he hasn't used the car he reserved after an hour from such reservation & \mbox{UserAppServer} \mbox{RentManager} \mbox{DataProvider}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G11} Allow a logged user to perform a complete rent: reserving a car, using it and leaving it terminating the rent, accomplishing the payment procedure related to aforementioned rent & \mbox{UserAppServer} \mbox{RentManager} \mbox{EventBroker} \mbox{CarHandler} \mbox{DataProvider}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G12} Calculate and charge the user for the correct amount of money he has to pay for his last ride, also considering the various discounts and fees applicable based on the ride & \mbox{RentMaganer} \mbox{CarHandler} \mbox{DataProvider}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G13} Allow a logged user to enable a money saving option which provides him with a charging station as destination of the ride to get a discount on the cost of the aforementioned ride & \mbox{UserAppServer} \mbox{RentManager} \mbox{DataProvider}\\

\subsection{Non functional requirements}
\paragraph{Performance requirements}
To guarantee a short response time we have tried to decouple components in order to enable an instance pooling management of components by the EJB container and so an as much as possible concurrent management of requests. \\
During all the design process we also have kept in mind the scalability of the software w.r.t. the number of cars trying to keep a linear complexity factor and to reduce car-dependent activities where it is possible.

\paragraph{Availability}
To ensure availability requirements server will be running 24 hours for day. The architecture is designed with the purpose of enabling a redundancy architecture if availability constraints would make it necessary.

\paragraph{Security}
Security protocols are used for transmission and storage of sensitive data.
Maintenance API is only accessible through token mechanisms.
Customer Care Server is accessed over a VPN to ensure security.

\paragraph{Portability}
Users access the system through a web-based application that enables the portability and a cross-operative system compatibility.
