\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of the Power EnJoy Project Plan is to provide an overview of the project with respect of parameters related to the project management. This document provides an estimated expected cost and effort for the project based upon techniques to support the estimation
procedure (Function Points, COCOMO II), proposes a possible schedule for the project and a related allocation of resources to accomplish tasks identified, describes the possible risks related to the project presenting some possible plans to manage them.


\subsection{Scope}
PowerEnJoy is a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars; we are going to develop a web-based software system that will provide the functionalities normally provided by car-sharing services, such as allowing the user to register to the system in order to access it, showing the cars available near a given location and allowing a user to reserve a car before picking it up.
A screen located inside the car will show in real time the ride amount of money to the user. When the user reaches a predefined safe area and exits the car, the system will stop charging the user and will lock the car. The system will provide information about charging station location where the car can be plugged after the ride and incentivize virtuous behaviours of the users with discounts \cite{RASD}.
