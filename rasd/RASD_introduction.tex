\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of a \textbf{R}equirement \textbf{A}nalysis and \textbf{S}pecifications \textbf{D}ocument is the process of discovering the purpose for which a software system was intended, by identifying stakeholders and their needs, and documenting these in a form that is amenable to analysis, communication, and subsequent implementation. \todo{Citation} It is also concerned with the relationship of software's factors such as goals, functions and constrains to precise specifications of software behavior, and to their evolution over time and across software families.

\subsection{Actual system}
The system we are to develop is brand new, there is no previous system.

\subsection{Scope}
PowerEnJoy is a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars; we are going to develop a web-based software system that will provide the functionalities normally provided by car-sharing services, such as allowing the user to register to the system in order to access it, showing the cars available near a given location and allowing a user to reserve a car before picking it up.
A screen located inside the car will show in real time the ride amount of money to the user. When the user reaches a predefined safe area and exits the car, the system will stop charging the user and will lock the car. The system will provide information about charging station location where the car can be plugged after the ride and incentivize virtuous behaviours of the users with discounts.
	\subsubsection{Goals}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{G\arabic*}]
		\item \label{goal:register} Allow users to register to the system
		\item \label{goal:login}Allow registered users to authenticate to the system
		\item \label{goal:position}Provide authenticated users with the position of available cars
		\item \label{goal:notifyMaintenance} Notify maintenance service with a list of not available cars 
		\item \label{goal:maintenanceDone} Provide the maintenance service with a way to notify the system when a car is available again 
		\item \label{goal:needMaintenance} Provide the user with a way to contact customer service to report a damaged car
		\item \label{goal:usersHistory} Provide a way to show to the user his rent and payment history and make these information accessible also to the customer service
		\item \label{goal:banUnbanUsers}Provide customer service with a way to ban users in order to prevent them from reserving or using other cars, and enable them to use the service again
		\item \label{goal:carReservation} Allow a user to reserve a car, if available, and hold that reservation for an hour
		\item \label{goal:reservationFee}Charge the user for 1\euro\ in case he hasn't used the car he reserved after an hour from such reservation
		\item \label{goal:completeRent}Allow a user to perform a complete rent: reserving a car, using it and leaving it terminating the rent in a safe area, accomplishing the payment procedure related to aforementioned rent
		\item \label{goal:calculateCost}Calculate and charge the user for the correct amount of money he has to pay for his last ride, also considering the various discounts and fees applicable based on the ride
		\item \label{goal:moneySavingOption}Allow the user to enable a money saving option which provides him with a charging station as destination of the ride to get a discount on the cost of the aforementioned ride
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsubsection{Definitions}
	\begin{description}
		\item[System:]the PowerEnJoy software we are to develop
		\item[Company:] the company we are developing the system for
		\item[Guest \emph{or} Guest user:] person who access the system as non logged user
		\item[Logged user \emph{or} Authenticated user:] authenticated person who is interfacing with the system
		\item[User:] \todo{only logged user? to be consistent with requirements} guest user or logged user
		\item[Banned user:] a user that can not use the system, he can only contact the customer care service
		\item[Registration:]  interaction between a non registered user and the system in which the user, providing all of the information required by the system for the creation of an account, receives from the system the credentials needed to authenticate to the system
		\item[Car:] an electric car owned by the company
		\item[Available car:] the car can be reserved by a user(i.d. the car is working correctly and its battery level is not critical)
		\item[Reserved car:] the car has been reserved by a user
		\item[In use car:] the user has ignited the car engine and he is still in the car
		\item[Not available car:] the car can not be reserved by a user (i.d. the car is not working correctly or its battery level is critical), a maintenance operator will deal with it
		\item[Battery level critical:] battery level under 20\%
		\item[Charging station:] location where cars owned by the company can be charged using a provided plug
		\item[Authentication \emph{or} Login:] interaction between guests and the system that grants authenticated user's privileges to a guest user
		\item[Safe area:] area of the map where a rent can be terminated without the corresponding additional fee
		\item[Payment procedure:] process which realizes the monetary transaction between the user and the system
		\item[Restricted access API:] API that can be used only by authorized person or system
