  				detects the car position is more than 3 KM away from the nearest charging station
  				or the system detects a critical level of battery of the aforementioned car and the
  				battery is not on charge, the system must charge to the user paired with the \emph{In
  				Use} state of the aforementioned car the 30\% more on the last ride. 
   			\end{enumerate}
